# neucomm
Python libraries for a neutrino communication project I'm doing


**Note:** This is partly a learning exercise for me, so expect things to be a little rough

## Usage:
Download the correct .whl file (in dist) and run pip install *whl. Since this is still in development, I would recommend running in a virtual python environment (this is generally good advice anyway).

General usage is to create a proton extraction, and pass it to a model to generate a list of times that a neutrino was detected. As of 0.1.0, the only model is a very basic MINERvA model, for example:

```
import neucomm
extraction = neucomm.Extraction(6e10, 588, 5e-9, 1e-6, 1e-6)
neucomm.simple_minerva(extraction)
```
